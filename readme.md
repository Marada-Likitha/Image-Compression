# Image Compression using SVD

This code compresses an RGB image using SVD by truncating the singular values of each color channel's S matrix above a certain threshold value and then reconstructing the compressed image using the truncated U, S, and V matrices. By keeping only the most significant features or components of the image, this method reduces storage requirements while still preserving the image's visual quality.
